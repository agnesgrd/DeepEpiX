# Tuto 2: Create New Sensors Layout (Montage)

**What is a montage?** 

For clinicians, creating custom sensor montages is essential for efficient analysis. Rather than viewing all available channels, a montage allows you to focus on specific brain regions of interest, making it easier to identify and analyze neural activity patterns relevant to your clinical assessment.

## 1️⃣ Choose a Name

Click on the **➕ Create** button to begin.

## 2️⃣ Choose a Selection Method

You have two options:

=== "🖱️ Choose Sensors Manually"

    Select the sensors you want one by one.

=== "🎲 Choose with Random Pick"

    Apply a **% percentage** on all groups and/or **adjust counts** directly for each group

You can see the results live on the left side.

> 📚 *About groups:*
Sensor groups are defined based on anatomical brain regions as described in [paper references to be added].

## 3️⃣ Save and Locate

After you're satisfied, 💾 **save** your montage locally.

You can now find it in the **🗂️ Montage Table** or under **🧠 Select Montage** in the visualization pages.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
A montage is **specific** to the **channel name format** (e.g., `MRC22-2805` ≠ `A22`) and to the **available channels** of the patient loaded **at the time of creation**. This explains why a selected montage may not work properly during visualization, even when the channel formats appear similar.

## 4️⃣ Manage Your Montage

You can easily **delete** a montage by clicking on the **🗑️ trash icon** next to it.

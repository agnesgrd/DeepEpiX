This structure is schematic but aims to help you understand how the multi-page Dash app is organized.

Each page is defined in the `pages/` directory:

- The **layout** of each page is declared in `layout/`.
- The **interactivity (callbacks)** is handled in `callbacks/`.

> 🔎 Note: Since several pages share common callback functions, the callbacks, layout components, and utilities are organized by major components (e.g., `graph`, `history`, `ica`, `prediction`, `preprocessing`, etc.), rather than strictly by individual pages.
